## Why are templates needed?

- to keep the javascript server logic separate from html
- helps with code debugging
- furthur separating the different parts of html in separate files, help keep length of html file manageable

## Template engines

In order to use template files, a template engine is also needed. The template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual data, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client (that is, the browser).

examples of template engines : Pug, Mustache, Nunjucks, Handlebars, EJS

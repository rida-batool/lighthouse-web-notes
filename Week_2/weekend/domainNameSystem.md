Although there are many available DNS Record Types, there is a small subset that cover most use cases.

- A: most common; map a hostnames to IP address (IPv4, 32-bit address)

- NS: Name Server that is responsible for a DNS zone

- MX: Mail Exchange record specifies where email gets sent to

- CNAME: Canonical Name, an alias for another hostname

- AAAA: similar to A, but uses IPv6, 128-bit address

## Abstraction
Abstraction involves hiding the inner workings of an object in favor of exposing a simple interface to that object.

Abstraction makes it easy to change how an object works internally without having to change the code that uses the object.

Abstraction requires us to initially write more code to separate an object's interface from it's implementation.


## Single reponsibility Principle
Any class should only be responsible for a single part of the app's functionality.

Why do we do this? What's it all for?

To reduce duplicated code (reusability)
To break code up into sensibly-divided units (modularity).

**OOP by itself does not require the use of classes.**

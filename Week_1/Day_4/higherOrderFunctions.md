## Higher Order Functions

Functions that take in callbacks are referred to as Higher Order Functions.

OR

Higher-Order functions are any functions which operate on other functions.

E.G: filter and forEach() 

Having functions available to us as values allows us to pass them around.This is a major part of **Functional Programming**.

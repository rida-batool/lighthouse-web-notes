## Ajax is Asynchronous

Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. The term asynchronous (or commonly "async") refers to the fact that Ajax HTTP requests don't interrupt a user's interaction with the current web page. Instead of an HTTP response replacing the web page in the browser, it is passed to a JavaScript function, and that function is responsible for determining what to do with it. Often the JavaScript will modify the DOM to reflect the response from the server.

benefits:
- makes web pages more dynamic by allowing subsequent requests to be sent to the server without navigating away from the page.

## How Ajax works
Ajax requests are normal HTTP requests sent to a web server by some JavaScript on a web page. A lot of the time these requests are made after the user interacts with the page in some way, like clicking a button. 

## Ajax libraries
 JavaScript is capable of performing Ajax requests without any code libraries; Ajax is something all major browsers support.

 Some JS libraries try to improve the way that Ajax is done in JavaScript. The most popular one is jQuery.
